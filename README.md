**Build blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and DApps**

## What is this book about?
Ethereum enables the development of efficient, smart contracts that contain code. These smart contracts can interact with other smart contracts to make decisions, store data, and send Ether to others.Ethereum Projects for Beginners provides you with a clear introduction to creating cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. As you make your way through the book, you’ll get to grips with detailed step-by-step processes to build advanced Ethereum projects. Each project will teach you enough about Ethereum to be productive right away. You will learn how tokenization works, think in a decentralized way, and build blockchain-based distributed computing systems. Towards the end of the book, you will develop interesting Ethereum projects such as creating wallets and secure data sharing.By the end of this book, you will be able to tackle blockchain challenges by implementing end-to-end projects using the full power of the Ethereum blockchain.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Develop your ideas fast and efficiently using the Ethereum blockchain
* Make writing and deploying smart contracts easy and manageable
* Work with private data in blockchain applications
* Handle large files in blockchain applications
* Ensure your decentralized applications are safe
* Explore how Ethereum development frameworks work

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:

function sendCoin(address receiver, uint amount) public returns(bool
sufficient) {
 if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
 balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
 balances[receiver] += amount;


**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for individuals who want to build decentralized applications using blockchain technology and the power of Ethereum from scratch. Some prior knowledge of JavaScript is required, since most examples use a web frontend.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-5).
